/-! Walking a bounded tree from its leaves to its root, and what that walk computes. -/

namespace Ssz

variable {α : Type}

/--
Levels folded away one at a time, from the leaves upward.

The fill a level pads with is the empty subtree of the height reached so far.
That is what keeps a short level in step with the tree it sits in.

/--
Root of the bounded tree over a list of nodes, built from the leaves upward.

Nothing about the hash is assumed, so this holds of whatever a fold turns out to be.

/--
The walk reaches the root the specification names, at whatever height it starts.

Stated for a partial walk so the induction has something to hold on to.
The height reached so far fixes the padding, and both sides move it in step.
