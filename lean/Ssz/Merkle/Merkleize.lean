/-! The root of an SSZ Merkle tree, and the facts an implementation of it leans on. -/

namespace Ssz

variable {α : Type}

/--
Root of the perfect binary tree of a given depth.

Leaves arrive as a function from position to node, not as a list.

A tree wider than its data therefore needs no padding to describe.

    depth 2:

    parent hash
     +-- left parent hash
     |    +-- leaf 0
     |    `-- leaf 1
     `-- right parent hash
          +-- leaf 2
          `-- leaf 3

Nothing here reads a node, so this holds for any node type at all.

def subtreeRoot (combine : α → α → α) : (depth : Nat) → (leaves : Nat → α) → α
  | 0, leaves => leaves 0
  -- The right half sees the same leaves, shifted past the left half's width.
  | depth + 1, leaves =>
      combine
        (subtreeRoot combine depth leaves)
        (subtreeRoot combine depth fun i => leaves (i + 2 ^ depth))

/--
Root of the perfect binary tree of a given depth whose every leaf is zero.

A value with a large capacity is mostly padding, so implementations precompute this.
