/-! Generalized indices: naming one node of a tree, and the nodes a proof of it needs. -/

namespace Ssz

/--
Levels an index sits below the root, which is none at all for the root itself.

The leading bit of an index carries its depth, so the depth is the bit width less one.

def gindexDepth (index : Nat) : Except Err Nat :=
  if index < 1 then .error (.notAGindex index) else .ok (Nat.log2 index)

/-- Depth of an index, which is also the number of nodes on its proof branch. -/
def gindexLength (index : Nat) : Except Err Nat := do
  let depth ← gindexDepth index
  -- The root sits on no branch, so it has no length to report.
  if depth == 0 then .error .rootHasNoBranch else .ok depth

/-- Whether the branch turns right at the given depth, counted from the leaf. -/

/-- The node sharing a parent with this one. -/
def gindexSibling (index : Nat) : Nat :=
  index ^^^ 1

/-- One of the two nodes this one is the parent of. -/
def gindexChild (index : Nat) (rightSide : Bool) : Nat :=

def gindexParent (index : Nat) : Nat :=
  index / 2

/--
An index measured from one root, rebased onto a position in a larger tree.

An index carries its depth in its leading bit, so this splices rather than multiplies.

    outer 2, inner 24  ->  40, not 48
-/
def gindexConcat (outer inner : Nat) : Except Err Nat := do
  let _ ← gindexDepth outer
  let depth ← gindexDepth inner
  -- Dropping the inner leading bit is what makes this a splice and not a multiplication.
  return outer * 2 ^ depth + (inner - 2 ^ depth)

/--
The bottom turns of an index, read as an index of a tree of their own.

Undoes a splice, handing the rest of an index to the subtree it lands in.

    splice 2 and 24  ->  40
    read 40 back at the depth of 24  ->  24

def gindexRebase (index depth : Nat) : Nat :=
  2 ^ depth + gindexBelow index depth

/--
Position of one chunk on a progressive spine.

    level 1  holds chunk 0
    level 2  holds chunks 1 to 4
    level 3  holds chunks 5 to 20

A chunk keeps its place as the collection grows, so a proof of it outlives an append.

The index counts one level below the spine, since the shape mixes a word into its root.

  -- The subtree root is the spine node's left child, and the chunk sits below it.

    rejectClaimPaths indices rest

/--
Refuse an index set that cannot be verified soundly.

An empty request claims nothing, so nothing about the root would be checked.

A repeated index would keep one value and drop the other silently.

An ancestor claim can be overwritten when its descendants are folded upward.

/--
Nodes a proof must carry to authenticate all the given ones at once.

Every sibling on every branch, less the paths the verifier can rebuild.

Descending order fixes which proof value belongs to each helper index.
