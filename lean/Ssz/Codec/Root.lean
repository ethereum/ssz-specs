/--
The SSZ Merkle root of a value, read against the type it is meant to fit.

The layout supplies the leaves, the capacity, and the word to mix in.

Rooting evaluates that layout without restating any type-specific tree rule.

The budget bounds how far the rooting may descend into nested values.

The leaves in a half-open range, as nodes, each nested value rooted here.

A range is asked for where a proof walks into one part of a tree.

Building that proof then does not hash the whole value.

The budget is the type's own nesting, which is more than the rooting can spend.
