/--
Walk the spine of a progressive shape, one turn per level.

A clear bit turns left, into the level's own subtree.

A set bit turns right, onto the next level, which holds four times as many leaves.

Root of the subtree at one generalized index of a value's own Merkle tree.

The index is read from the top down, one bit per level.

The budget covers the declared type depth, which suffices for every addressable nested value.

/--
Root of the subtree at one generalized index of a value's own Merkle tree.

The budget is the type's nesting plus the index, which is more than the walk can spend:
each level enters one nested type or consumes one turn of the index.

/--
Branch that authenticates one generalized index of a value against its root.

Every node on the path contributes its sibling, bottom-up, as a verifier reads it.

def buildProof (shape : Desc) (value : Value) (index : Nat) : Except Err (List Bytes) := do
  (← getBranchIndices index).mapM (nodeRoot shape value)

/--
Nodes that authenticate several generalized indices of a value at once.

Only what a verifier cannot rebuild is carried.

Branches that meet share every node above the meeting point, and those are dropped.
