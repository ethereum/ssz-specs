Without a collision between the two computations, an SSZ root determines its whole value.
Counts are checked before comparing variable-shaped subtrees, and nested values use the same argument.

Conflicting values of the same well-formed type expose a collision in their expanded SSZ computations.
Every nested variable-size count must fit its 256-bit mixing word.
The witnesses are distinct 64-byte inputs with the same SHA-256 digest.
