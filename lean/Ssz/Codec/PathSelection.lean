/-! Paths through present values select mixing words, packed chunks, and nested Merkle nodes. -/

namespace Ssz

/--
A path's value-level meaning, using actual layout positions rather than assumed successful reads.

Packed elements select their containing chunk.
Composite descent requires a filled slot, so absent list elements and layout gaps have no child.
Progressive payload selection requires a present chunk, although the Merkle walker also reads padding.
