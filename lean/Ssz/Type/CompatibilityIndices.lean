Compatible progressive containers address a field of one name at one node.

    left   active [1,1]      names ["a","b"]        "b" sits at position 1
    right  active [1,1,1]    names ["a","b","c"]    "b" sits at position 1

Appending a field leaves every earlier field where it was.
A proof of "b" written against the shorter declaration therefore reads against the longer one.
Where no name is shared the two say nothing about each other, which is the other half of the rule.

The two declarations are required to differ.
A declaration that repeats a field name disagrees with its own layout, and is compatible
with itself only because a declaration is compared with itself before its layout is read.

A worked pair, so the theorems above are known to say something about real declarations.

    before  active [1,1]    names ["a","b"]        field "b" reads at index 40
    after   active [1,1,1]  names ["a","b","c"]    field "b" reads at index 40

The appended field takes index 41, which is a node the shorter declaration never named.
