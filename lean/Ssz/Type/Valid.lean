Two layouts may each agree with a third on shared positions and still clash.

Whether two field layouts place the fields they share alike.

A position set in both must hold one field name, of compatible types.
A name set in both must sit at one position.
That does not follow from the first rule, since one name can sit at two positions.
A position set in only one layout is free, the other leaving a zero leaf there.
