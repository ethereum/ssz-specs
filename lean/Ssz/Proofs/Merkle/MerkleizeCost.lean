/-! What a bounded root costs in hashes, and why a large capacity barely adds to it. -/

namespace Ssz

/--
Hashes a bounded root costs, counted along the recursion that produces it.

A subtree beginning past the data is answered from the precomputed table, so it costs nothing.

A leaf is read rather than hashed.

Every other node pays one hash to fold its two halves together.

A subtree that lies inside the data reaches every one of its leaves.

Its cost is then one hash short of its width, which is the price of the naive walk.

Above the point where the data already fits, each level costs exactly one hash.

The sibling on every such level is an all-zero subtree, which the table answers.

Merkleizing nonempty data costs under twice the chunk count plus the logarithm of the width.

The capacity enters only through that logarithm, however far it exceeds the data.

Each term pays for one regime: the fold over the data, and the climb above it.

A walk that materializes every leaf of the capacity's tree costs one hash short of the width.

That is what the precomputed table saves, and it grows with the capacity rather than the data.
