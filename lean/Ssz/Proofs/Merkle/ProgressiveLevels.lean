/-! Where each level of a progressive spine begins, and how deep its chunks sit. -/

Chunks the levels before this one hold together, which is where this one starts.

Levels are counted from zero here, so level `n` of the specification is level `n - 1`.

The levels up to one exhaust a third of the next power of four.

Written without division: three times the start, plus the one chunk of level zero.

/--
The index of a chunk, in closed form, from any point of the walk.

The widths seen from a given depth are that depth's own width times one, four, sixteen, and
so on, which is why the level start is scaled by it.

/--
The index a chunk of a progressive collection sits at.

A chunk keeps this index however long the collection grows, since nothing in it depends on
the number of chunks held.

/--
Levels a chunk sits below the value's own root, which is the node count of its proof.

A chunk of level `level` sits three levels further down for each level along, plus the two
the spine root and the mixed-in word take.

This is what fixes the cost of a proof about a progressive collection: it grows with the
logarithm of the chunk number, at three hashes per factor of four.
